# pizza-classifier

A very simple classifier using neural network. We take image of burnt and good pizza as input to the model so that it is able to easily classify them.
Only used dense layers to do the implementation. We can further experiment with different layers.

Can be run in google-colab, just need to upload the dataset into the drive.
